        I'm a person who grew up during a time technology was advancing. For instance, the internet today is vastly different from 20. People can search things a lot faster and even meet people through different social media platforms. There are millions of people who use Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Tumblr just to name a few. Not only are these platforms used to meet people it can be used to spread one's interest. Many of these interests can be video games, sports, photography, modeling, and art. That is just the surface to what any platform can have.

        Seeing as millions of people have social media, me included, its natural people can be influenced by what they see. People can play a certain video game, start a diet, or even make art work based of what they see. That is where social media plays into my art work, it is especially influenced by Tumblr. The perfect way to describe what my art style would be "Alien Aesthetic."

        A simple search on Tumblr will provide you with an array of pinks, purples, greens, blues, aliens, space, and the occasional cat in outer space. Other than the "Alien Aesthetic" my art is inspired by video games and youtubers. My 3D object was inspired by an Overwatch characters companion that I enjoy playing.  As for my video, I noticed it had similarities to what one might call a "travel vlog." Where it has its beginning  by getting on the light rail, finishes by riding away, and is very focused on music. I hope to continue making art by the inspiration of social media and am hoping to see how social media will evolve and inspire me.
